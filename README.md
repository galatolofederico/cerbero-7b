## Model Evaluation Results üìà

The `cerbero-7b` model has been rigorously evaluated across several benchmarks to demonstrate its proficiency in understanding and generating Italian text. Below are the summarized results showcasing its performance:

### SQuAD-it Evaluation

The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) in Italian (SQuAD-it) is used to evaluate the model's reading comprehension and question-answering capabilities. The following table presents the F1 score and Exact Match (EM) metrics:

| Model                                        | F1 Score | Exact Match (EM) |

## Why Cerbero? ü§î

The name "Cerbero," inspired by the three-headed dog that guards the gates of the Underworld in Greek mythology, encapsulates the essence of our model, drawing strength from three foundational pillars:

- **Base Model: mistral-7b** üèóÔ∏è
  cerbero-7b builds upon the formidable **mistral-7b** as its base model. This choice ensures a robust foundation, leveraging the power and capabilities of a cutting-edge language model.

- **Datasets: Cerbero Dataset** üìö
  The Cerbero Dataset is a groundbreaking collection specifically curated to enhance the proficiency of cerbero-7b in understanding and generating Italian text. This dataset is a product of an innovative method combining dynamic self-chat mechanisms with advanced Large Language Model (LLM) technology. Refer to the [paper](README.md) for more details.

- **Licensing: Apache 2.0** üïäÔ∏è
  Released under the **permissive Apache 2.0 license**, cerbero-7b promotes openness and collaboration. This licensing choice empowers developers with the freedom for unrestricted usage, fostering a community-driven approach to advancing AI in Italy and beyond.

## Training Details üöÄ

**cerbero-7b** is a **fully fine-tuned** LLM, distinguishing itself from LORA or QLORA fine-tunes. 
The model is trained on an expansive Italian Large Language Model (LLM) using synthetic datasets generated through dynamic self-chat on a large context window of **8192 tokens**

### Dataset Composition üìä

## Getting Started üöÄ

You can load **cerbero-7b** using [ü§ótransformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("galatolo/cerbero-7b")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("galatolo/cerbero-7b")

prompt = """Questa √® una conversazione tra un umano ed un assistente AI.
[|Umano|] Come posso distinguere un AI da un umano?
[|AI|]"""

input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt').input_ids
with torch.no_grad():
    output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=128)

generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)
```
